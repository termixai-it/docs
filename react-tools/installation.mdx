# Installation & Quick Start

Get up and running with @termix-it/react-tool in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the library, make sure you have:

- **React 16.9.0 or later**
- **Node.js 14 or later**
- **A Termix project** with AI configuration set up

## Installation

Install the library using your preferred package manager:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @termix-it/react-tool
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @termix-it/react-tool
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @termix-it/react-tool
```
</CodeGroup>

After installation, you'll have access to:
- ✅ ChatInterface component with AI chat capabilities
- ✅ ChatWidget component for floating chat button
- ✅ Built-in styles (no separate CSS import needed)
- ✅ Built-in UI components (Lucide icons, Markdown rendering)
- ✅ TypeScript support with full type definitions
- ✅ Automatic knowledge base integration
- ✅ Function calling (REST APIs & smart contracts)
- ✅ Real-time streaming support
- ✅ Tree-shaking optimized (only bundles what you use)

## Peer Dependencies

This library requires the following peer dependencies to be installed in your project:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install react react-dom ethers
```

```bash yarn
yarn add react react-dom ethers
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add react react-dom ethers
```
</CodeGroup>

**Required peer dependencies:**

```json
{
  "react": ">=16.9.0",
  "react-dom": ">=16.9.0",
  "ethers": "^5.7.0 || ^6.15.0"
}
```

<Note>
**UI dependencies** (`lucide-react`, `react-markdown`, `remark-breaks`, `remark-gfm`) are now bundled with the library and support tree-shaking to minimize bundle size. Only the icons and markdown features you use will be included in your final build.
</Note>

### Ethers.js Version Compatibility

This library supports both **ethers v5** and **ethers v6** through an internal compatibility layer. You can use either version in your project:

- **ethers v5**: `npm install ethers@^5.7.0`
- **ethers v6**: `npm install ethers@^6.15.0`

The library will automatically detect which version you have installed and adapt accordingly. All Web3-related functionality (smart contract calls, wallet connections, etc.) works seamlessly with both versions.

<Tip>
**Recommendation:** We recommend using ethers v6 for new projects as it offers better performance and improved TypeScript support. However, if your project already uses ethers v5, you don't need to upgrade - this library will work perfectly with your existing setup.
</Tip>

## Styles

Styles are now automatically bundled with the components - no separate CSS import needed! All styles are scoped with `.termix-` prefix to prevent conflicts.

<Tip>
If you're already using Tailwind CSS in your project, the bundled styles won't conflict with your existing styles due to the `.termix-` prefix scoping.
</Tip>

## Basic Setup

### Minimal Setup

The absolute minimum code needed to get started:

```tsx App.tsx
import { ChatInterface } from '@termix-it/react-tool';

function App() {
  return (
    <ChatInterface
      projectId="your-project-id"
      aiConfigId="your-ai-config-id"
    />
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Basic Usage with Common Options

Here's a more complete setup with commonly used options:

```tsx App.tsx
import { ChatInterface } from '@termix-it/react-tool';
// No need to import CSS - styles are now bundled with components

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="h-screen">
      <ChatInterface
        // Required props
        projectId="your-project-id"
        aiConfigId="your-ai-config-id"

        // Authentication (optional but recommended)
        authorization="Bearer your-jwt-token"

        // Common options
        enableStreamingMode={true} // Enable real-time streaming
        showHeader={false} // Set to true to show chat header
        placeholder="Type your message..."

        // Optional callbacks
        onMessageSent={(message) => console.log('Sent:', message)}
        onResponseReceived={(message) => console.log('Received:', message)}
        onError={(error) => console.error('Error:', error)}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Alternative Setups

### ChatWidget for Floating Interface

For a non-intrusive floating chat widget, use the `ChatWidget` component:

```tsx FloatingChat.tsx
import { ChatWidget, ChatInterface } from '@termix-it/react-tool';
// No need to import CSS - styles are now bundled with components

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="relative h-screen">
      {/* Your main application content */}
      <div>Your application content here</div>

      {/* Floating chat widget - positioned bottom right */}
      <div className="fixed bottom-6 right-6">
        <ChatWidget
          title="AI Assistant" // Dialog header title
          defaultOpen={false} // Start closed
          onOpenChange={(open) => console.log('Widget open:', open)}
        >
          <ChatInterface
            // Required props
            projectId="your-project-id"
            aiConfigId="your-ai-config-id"

            // Authentication
            authorization="Bearer your-token"

            // Features
            enableStreamingMode={true}
            showHeader={false} // Widget has its own header

            // Style
            className="h-full"
          />
        </ChatWidget>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Streaming Mode Setup

Enable real-time streaming responses for a more dynamic experience:

```tsx StreamingChat.tsx
import { ChatInterface } from '@termix-it/react-tool';

function StreamingApp() {
  return (
    <div className="h-screen">
      <ChatInterface
        projectId="your-project-id"
        aiConfigId="your-ai-config-id"
        authorization="Bearer your-token"
        enableStreamingMode={true} // Real-time character-by-character display
        placeholder="Ask me anything..."
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default StreamingApp;
```

## Configuration Parameters

You'll need these essential parameters to get started:

<ParamField path="projectId" type="string" required>
  Your Termix project identifier. You can find this in your Termix dashboard.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="aiConfigId" type="string" required>
  AI configuration identifier that defines the model and behavior settings.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="authorization" type="string">
  Authorization header value, typically a Bearer token for authentication (optional but recommended).
</ParamField>

<Info>
**Streaming Mode Requirements**: If you enable `enableStreamingMode={true}`, your proxy endpoint must support Server-Sent Events (SSE). See the [Streaming Mode guide](/react-tools/streaming) for detailed implementation instructions.
</Info>

## Testing Your Setup

Once you have the basic setup complete, you should see:

1. **Chat interface** rendered on your page
2. **Welcome message** displayed in the chat
3. **Input field** ready for user messages
4. **Send button** to submit messages

Try sending a test message to verify the connection is working properly.

### Testing Streaming Mode

If you enabled streaming mode, you should see:
- Characters appearing one by one as the AI responds
- No loading spinner during responses
- Real-time typing effect
